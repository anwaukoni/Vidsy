# Vidsy

### To run it: 

* cd into Vidsy
* install packages with "npm install"
* run "node server.js" (runs on port 8080)
* open another terminal window and run "gulp" (gulp should already be installed globally: "npm install -g gulp")

###This should automatically open the application in your browser. Let me know of any problems, thanks.
